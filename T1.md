## Part 2

### 1. What will your server do?

Our server is used for task management. Users can create their own task lists, add tasks into lists, and view and manage the tasks. Users can also connect to the server by HTTP PUSH, so it can get updates in time.

### 2. Who or what will be its users?

Users who want to manage multiple tasks and schedule their timetable carefully are prospective to use our service.

### 3. What kind of data will your service create or accumulate? What will the data be used for?

1) We need to collect user's information to identify different users and customize our service for each user.
2) We create a database scheme named `task_list` which uses `user_id` and `task_list_id` as a key. This scheme is used for maintaining different task lists for different users.
3) We create another database scheme named `task` which uses `task_list_id` and `task_id` as a key. This scheme is used for storing different tasks for different task lists.
4) TODO: user table.

## Part 3

### 1. How will you test that your service does what it is supposed to do and provides the intended functionality?

TODO

### 2. How will you check that your service does not behave badly if its clients use it in unintended ways or provide invalid inputs?

Before applying any user input data for out server computation, we need to validate the inputs by checking against only a range of valid inputs. 

1) Data type
Check the data type of the input. If the value needs to be numeric, for example fields like 'age', 'phone number', 'credit card number' etc, check if the provided value is numeric. 

2) Data range
If the value needs to be numeric and data provided is also numeric, check if the provided value within the reasonable range. For example, we don't expect a person with age higher than 150 or a US phone number to be longer than 10 digits.

3) Data content
If the value needs to be string and data provided is also string, check if the provided value contains invalid characters. For example, we don't expect characters like '*', '[', ']', '+' etc to be part of the name of a person.

4) Testing against invalid inputs
Input invalid inputs for each of the above category and see if the inputs got rejected.
Input extremely long size input to see if the input size is limited.
Input malicious SQL and NON-SQL injection to see if our input validation rejects them.

We should not be crashing our service or return unexpected outputs to user under any unintended use cases and invald inputs.
