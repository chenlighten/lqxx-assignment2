## Part 2

### 1. What will your server do?

Our server is used for task management. Users can create their own task lists, add tasks into lists, and view and manage the tasks. Users can also connect to the server by HTTP PUSH, so it can get updates in time.

### 2. Who or what will be its users?

Users who want to manage multiple tasks and schedule their timetable carefully are prospective to use our service.

### 3. What kind of data will your service create or accumulate? What will the data be used for?

1) We need to collect user's information to identify different users and customize our service for each user.
2) We create a database scheme named `task_list` which uses `user_id` and `task_list_id` as a key. This scheme is used for maintaining different task lists for different users.
3) We create another database scheme named `task` which uses `task_list_id` and `task_id` as a key. This scheme is used for storing different tasks for different task lists.
4) TODO: user table.

## Part 3

### 1. How will you test that your service does what it is supposed to do and provides the intended functionality?

TODO

### 2. How will you check that your service does not behave badly if its clients use it in unintended ways or provide invalid inputs?

TODO

### 3. How will you test that your service handles its data the way its supposed to?

1) Data mapping checking. We'll ensure the data fields in databases, backend service and returned values
are consistent with each other by conducting integrated white-box test, where the same data field in
a service workflow will be tracked and compared to secure the correctness of data mapping.

2) Data atomicity and consistency checking. The atomicity and consistency of data will be checked by
sending a massive amount of requests combined with good ones and bad ones to the server. We'll check the database
after the execution of the requests and see if the atomicity and consistency of data is violated
in the chaos of massive requests.

3) Data isolation checking. We'll ensure data is isolated in a proper way by testing the service with
concurrent requests from same and different users and see if the request will interfere each other.

3) Data security checking. The security of data will be ensured by testing the service with some
bad-intended requests. We'll see if there's any possible data leakage or damage in the test.
