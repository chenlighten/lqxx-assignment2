## Part 2

### 1. What will your server do?

Our server is used for task management. Users can create their own task lists, add tasks into lists, and view and manage the tasks. Users can also connect to the server by HTTP PUSH, so it can get updates in time.

### 2. Who or what will be its users?

Users who want to manage multiple tasks and schedule their timetable carefully are prospective to use our service.

### 3. What kind of data will your service create or accumulate? What will the data be used for?

1) We need to collect user's information to identify different users and customize our service for each user.
2) We create a database scheme named `task_list` which uses `user_id` and `task_list_id` as a key. This scheme is used for maintaining different task lists for different users.
3) We create another database scheme named `task` which uses `task_list_id` and `task_id` as a key. This scheme is used for storing different tasks for different task lists.
4) TODO: user table.
