## Part 2

### 1. What will your server do?

Our server is used for task management. Users can create their own task lists, add tasks into lists, and view and manage the tasks. Users can suscribe their task lists by HTTP PUSH, so it can get updates in time. In addition, multiple users can cooperate on one task lists.

### 2. Who or what will be its users?

Users who want to manage multiple tasks and schedule their timetable carefully are prospective to use our service. Moreover, our taks management service can be generalized to support any list applications, such as wishing lists, shipping lists, etc.

### 3. What kind of data will your service create or accumulate? What will the data be used for?

1) We need to collect user's information to identify different users and customize our service for each user.
2) We create a database scheme named `user` which uses `user_id` as a key. This scheme stores user information.
3) We create a database scheme named `task_list` which uses unique `task_list_id` as a key. This scheme is used for maintaining different task lists for different users.
4) We create another database scheme named `task` which uses `task_list_id` and `task_id` as a key. This scheme is used for storing different tasks for different task lists.

## Part 3

### 1. How will you test that your service does what it is supposed to do and provides the intended functionality?

It should take three different levels of testing to check that our service will provide the intended functionality.

* Unit testing: testing individual modules (without dependency) of our code, such as functions and classes, which will work fine.
* Integration testing: combine these individual modules and test them as a group to make sure they will still work. 
* System testing: test the whole system whether is supposed to work or not. We can first run our services locally, then we can deploy our services on the cloud and test the system in the production environment. 

When doing these tests, we would like to use automation testing tools. We should follow these steps to complete our testing:

* First, select the correct testing tools. The tools should satisfy the requirements for our project. For example, the tool can support testing across different environments and can give feedback to us, either logging or reporting. We already know some appropriate tools from classes, such as googletest for unit testing.
* Second, writing test cases. We should do both positive testing and negative testing. Doing positive testing to ensure our services' functions are correct. Doing negative testing to ensure our services will work even when it is subjected to unexpected data, such as NULL and boundary values.   
* Finally, call testing and fix our code. After preparing test cases and test environment, we run testing. Then, we can fix our bugs by carefully analyzing the output in the log. Then we repeat the process until there is no functional error in our project.

### 2. How will you check that your service does not behave badly if its clients use it in unintended ways or provide invalid inputs?

Before applying any user input data for out server computation, we need to validate the inputs by checking against only a range of valid inputs. 

1) Data type
Check the data type of the input. If the value needs to be numeric, for example fields like 'age', 'phone number', 'credit card number' etc, check if the provided value is numeric. 

2) Data range
If the value needs to be numeric and data provided is also numeric, check if the provided value within the reasonable range. For example, we don't expect a person with age higher than 150 or a US phone number to be longer than 10 digits.

3) Data content
If the value needs to be string and data provided is also string, check if the provided value contains invalid characters. For example, we don't expect characters like '*', '[', ']', '+' etc to be part of the name of a person.

4) Testing against invalid inputs
Input invalid inputs for each of the above category and see if the inputs got rejected.
Input extremely long size input to see if the input size is limited.
Input malicious SQL and NON-SQL injection to see if our input validation rejects them.

We should not be crashing our service or return unexpected outputs to user under any unintended use cases and invald inputs.

### 3. How will you test that your service handles its data the way its supposed to?

1) Data mapping checking. We'll ensure the data fields in databases, backend service and returned values
are consistent with each other by conducting integrated white-box test, where the same data field in
a service workflow will be tracked and compared to secure the correctness of data mapping.

2) Data atomicity and consistency checking. The atomicity and consistency of data will be checked by
sending a massive amount of requests combined with good ones and bad ones to the server. We'll check the database
after the execution of the requests and see if the atomicity and consistency of data is violated
in the chaos of massive requests.

3) Data isolation checking. We'll ensure data is isolated in a proper way by testing the service with
concurrent requests from same and different users and see if the request will interfere each other.

3) Data security checking. The security of data will be ensured by testing the service with some
bad-intended requests. We'll see if there's any possible data leakage or damage in the test.
